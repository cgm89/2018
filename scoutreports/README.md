# Artifacts from student "scouting expeditions" to data analysis topics and resources

## Ideas for scouting demos - Computing

### General computing culture 
* Index, summarize, sample from RSMAS lunch-bytes on github.com/milancuric
* Flowcharts and pseudocode 
* Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry
* Workflow management ideas/tools? 
* HPC issues for Python 
    * (GIL limit, parallelization, dask, conda-forge for all-platform compiled.f wrapping, ... ? )
* Cloud and commodity computing
  * Google vs. AWS vs. Azure 
  * Containerization (Docker) 

### Python and Jupyter: packages and galleries 
* Faceted searches on Github 
* pip and conda - discover(?) and install 
* Graphics: Pandas, Seaborn, Geoviews, Matplotlib 
* Galleries: results-shaped containers 
* jupyter-lab 

* Main stem toolsets
  * Numpy and Scipy
  * scikit-learn (machine learning)

### Jupyter notebooks of interest
* kaggle.com
* spyndle

### Run notebooks on somebody else's processors
* binder
* wakari
* microsoft azure 
* hydroshare

### Other software, languages, tools

#### Installable analysis frameworks
* Python IDE's: Spyder, PyCharm
* https://www.rstudio.com/
   * run code from http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2018/01/the-claim-of-reduced-uncertainty-for-equilibrium-climate-sensitivity-is-premature/ fo instance
* Matlab Live Script (cf. Jupyter notebook) 
* GrADs 
* NCL 
* NCO, CDO (analysis, no graphics)
* Audacity (for audio -- we may use in Fourier exercises)

#### Online analysis platforms
* ClimateExploer.knmi.nl
* psd.noaa.gov
* Ingrid.ldeo.columbia.edu
* Live Access Servers (Ferrett) 
* Giovanni.nasa.gov 

#### Tools for thought
