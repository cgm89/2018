# Module 1
From module 1, I got a decent intro to statistics in science. My only background in "stats" before this class was prob/stats for engineers and it was a VERY basic class that focused 90% on probability. I had never heard of Degrees of Freedom, Variance and to be honest, I wasn't entirely sure what standard deviation TRULY meant. After this module, I had a much better grasp on statistics and how it's used in science.
