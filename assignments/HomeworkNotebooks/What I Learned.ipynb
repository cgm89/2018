    "# Module 1\n",
    "From module 1, I got a decent intro to statistics in science. My only background in \"stats\" before this class was prob/stats for engineers and it was a VERY basic class that focused 90% on probability. I had never heard of Degrees of Freedom, Variance, regression and to be honest, I wasn't entirely sure what standard deviation TRULY meant. After this module, I had a much better grasp on statistics and how it's used in science. I also was able to slightly grasp very basic python and I attempted to understand all the things we downloaded at the beginning of the semester and how they were all connected. It was not until later in the semester that I understood the flow between Anaconda, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub. It was a lot to take in with a limited background in programming (although I had a basic introduction to programming from engineering but we mostly touched on C, C++, and SOME MatLab)...\n",

    "Module 2 was interesting for me because I have had a \"Signals and Systems\" course in undergrad for electrical engineering. \"Fourier\" is a pretty familiar term to me and had been thrown around like a rag doll in engineering school. It wasn't until this module that I actually got a grasp on what it was for! I loved using the KNMI climate explorer and pulling in NetCDF files into notebooks and making figures with them! I finally understand the purpose of \"filtering\" data!\n",

    "I have never heard of an EOF before IN MY LIFE. But this was an awesome module. I learned what an EOF was, why it was used, and how to do it myself! The \"EOF of a video\" Notebook was so much fun and I learned a lot from working with it! It definitely took a complicated topic and made it fun and easier to understand."
