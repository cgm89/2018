   - #### Test: Your first Fork and Pull Request (PR) (our first collaboration!) 

      - Go to the master copy at https://github.com/MPO624/MPO624-2018
         * Fork it. 
         * Click _PARTICIPANTLIST.md_. 
         * Click the pencil icon, and edit the markdown (it should be self-explanatory). 
         * Commit your edits (with a non-default comment, if you like). 
         * When done, make a _Pull Request_. That comes to me, and you'll see my responses in your email. Or, you can always check the status of your request thread on the web site.
